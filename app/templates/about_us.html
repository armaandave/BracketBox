                    My name is Armaan, and I am a 16 year old who loves movies and numbers. After watching a movie, I'd always Google that movie, to find any fun facts or see who the actors were. I'd always come accross a box office section, that would say how much money the movie made. I had no idea what was good and what was bad. Was $100,000,000 good? Was $500,000,000? There was no way to know. So, I created BracketBox. Not only does it have all the Box Office data you could need, but it also creates a score based on the overall box office performance of that movie, allowing you to quantify the success of that movie compared to others. 
                </h5>
                <h3 class="ml-3">What does our score signify?</h3>
                <h5 class="ml-3">
                    To calculate our score, I combined a variety of different factors to calculate the risk and reward a movie takes, as well as the overall success. Most people think the only important factor is profit. This is NOT true. Let's compare two films: <br> <br> Film A, which had a budget of $25,000,000 and made $500,000,000 at the box office and <br><br> Film B, which had a budget of $200,000,000 and made $800,000,000 at the box office.<br><br> At First glance, it would seem obvious that movie B did better because it made more money, and also had more of a profit. But at a closer look, we can see that movie A had a much lower budget than movie B, and almost made the same amount of money. A movie with a lower budget has a much lower chance of succeeding because it is investing much less money into itself. A movie with a high budget, suchh as movie B, likely has A-list actors and a heavy advertising campaign to back it. Movie A, on the other hand, relies completely on the quality of the film to make money. This makes movie A's performance at the box office, MUCH more impressive than movie B.
